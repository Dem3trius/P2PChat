My first course project.
This program allows u chat with friends and transmit files via local
network. It features :
- conference chats;
- file transmit;
- contacts list & notifications about your contacts's logins/logouts;
- P2P architecture.

Known bugs : cant transmit large files (dunno why).

Do not have any reason to continue develop this project.
